BlackLink is an advanced DC++ client, initially started as a fork of [FlylinkDC++](https://github.com/pavel-pimenov/flylinkdc-r5xx).

## Features

- Supports TLS 1.3
- Supports IPv4 and IPv6
- Supports StrongDC++'s DHT (Distributed Hash Table)
- CCPM feature (encrypted client-to-client private messages)
- Automatic port forwarding with UPnP or NAT-PMP
- High performance hash database using the [LMDB](https://github.com/LMDB/lmdb) engine
- Allows to use a single port for both TLS and unencrypted TCP connections; only one open TCP and one UDP port is required for full active mode
- Tons of bugfixes and improvements
- No ads, no preference for specific hubs
